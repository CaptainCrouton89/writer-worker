<task>
Generate exactly 4 subtle writing quirks that enhance the narrative without disrupting flow. Focus on techniques that feel natural and unobtrusive.
</task>

<format>
Each quirk MUST follow: "[Name] - [How it appears in text]"
Example: "Italic Memories - Brief flashbacks appear in italics, usually one sentence"
</format>

<types_of_quirks>
**Sentence Structure:**
- One-word sentences for emphasis ("Perfect." "Never." "Finally.")
- Fragment sentences during intense moments ("Just breathing. Waiting.")
- Run-on sentences during overwhelming emotions
- Starting sentences with "And" or "But" for conversational flow

**Memory & Time:**
- Italic flashbacks (1-2 sentences max)
- Present tense for memories
- Time skips marked by extra line breaks
- Sensory triggers for memories (a scent, a sound)

**Emphasis Techniques:**
- Repetition for impact ("She ran. Ran until her lungs burned.")
- Em-dashes for interruptions or sudden thoughts
- Ellipses for trailing thoughts or hesitation
- Parenthetical asides (brief internal commentary)

**Narrative Rhythm:**
- Short paragraphs during action (1-2 sentences)
- Longer paragraphs for description/reflection
- Single-line dialogue without tags in rapid exchanges
- Sentence fragments in emotional peaks

**Sensory Focus:**
- Temperature descriptions for emotional states
- Sound emphasis during tense moments
- Texture focus during intimate scenes
- Scent memories linking to past

**Internal Voice:**
- Rhetorical questions in narration
- Direct thoughts without italics or tags
- Second-person internal dialogue ("You know better than this")
- Stream of consciousness during stress
</types_of_quirks>

<examples>
- "Italic Flashbacks - Brief memories in italics interrupt the narrative, usually one sentence"
- "One-Word Impact - Single-word sentences for emotional emphasis"
- "Fragment Tension - Incomplete sentences during high-stress moments"
- "Sensory Memories - Specific scents or sounds trigger brief flashback lines"
- "Em-dash Thoughts - Sudden realizations interrupt sentences with em-dashes"
- "Rhetorical Questions - Narrator poses unanswered questions to build tension"
- "Temperature Emotions - Heat and cold describe emotional states"
- "And/But Starters - Sentences begin with conjunctions for conversational flow"
</examples>

<requirements>
✓ All quirks must be subtle and unobtrusive
✓ Focus on enhancing emotion and pacing
✓ Avoid anything that feels gimmicky
✓ Keep techniques that readers won't consciously notice
✓ Ensure natural integration with narrative flow
</requirements>
